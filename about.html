		<h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I didn't read much growing up.  My parents spoke Spanish but my father <br \>
            insisted we speak English at home.  He spoke Spanish but spoke English at work.<br \>
            We didn't have books around the house and we didn't go to the library.<br \>
            I learned to read from a neighbor who was two years younger than I.<br \> 
            Her parents bought her books to read.  In the summer, we spent most mornings<br \>
            reading together.  She moved away when I was 10 years old.  
        </p>
        <p>I stopped trying to read school textbooks after the 4th grade.  I simply didn't <br \>
            have the language skills or the vocabulary.  I chose a profession that prioritized <br \>
            math and science because I learned to understand those symbols, equations, and concepts.<br \>
            
            After I had children, I came across a snippet of a poem while they were in preschool.<br \>
            I looked it up and it inspired me.  (It is listed under the "Site Navigation List".)<br \>
            I read many books to them and as they learned to read, so did I.<br \>
            Later, I took some online classes in psychology and I learn how to write effectively.<br \>
            <br \>
            Now, reading is my superpower and I am still making up for lost time.
