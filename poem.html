        <h2><cite>The Reading Mother</cite> by Strickland Gillilan </h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.yourdailypoem.com/listpoem.jsp?poem_id=352">
  
        I had a mother who read to me<br \>
        Sagas of pirates who scoured the sea,<br \>
        Cutlasses clenched in their yellow teeth,<br \>
        "Blackbirds" stowed in the hold beneath.<br \>
        <br \>
        
        I had a Mother who read me lays<br \>
        Of ancient and gallant and golden days;<br \>
        Stories of Marmion and Ivanhoe,<br \>
        Which every boy has a right to know.<br \>
        <br \>  
        
        I had a Mother who read me tales<br \>
        Of Gelert the hound of the hills of Wales,<br \>
        True to his trust till his tragic death,<br \>
        Faithfulness blent with his final breath.<br \>
        
        <br \>
        I had a Mother who read me the things<br \>
        That wholesome life to the boy heart brings--<br \>
        Stories that stir with an upward touch,<br \>
        Oh, that each mother of boys were such!<br \>
        
        <br \>
        You may have tangible wealth untold;<br \>
        Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold.<br \>
        Richer than I you can never be--<br \>
        I had a Mother who read to me.<br \>
        <br \>
